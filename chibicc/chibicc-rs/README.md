# chibicc-rs

See the TODO in "build.rs" to specify the RISC-V toolchain path on disk to use

Further work will abstract away the need to do this

The core work happens in `chibicc/string_to_bin.c`

A POSIX IO stub implementation is available at `chibicc/posixio_stub.c`

More documentation forthcoming
